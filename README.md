<h4>Bacterial Assemblages and Identity Library Online (BASILIO)</h4>

A Bacterial Database focuses on gathering literatures on animal microbiome around the globe, process the information
and integrate in the BASILIO website. BASILIO is a browser for wide-array of bacteria, focusing more on
Microbiota across different animals and supports research in Microbiology, Taxonomy and Genomics.
BASILIO contains listing of microorganisms found in the animals identified thru culture-dependent and
culture-independent techniques. With BASILIO, access for researches related to microbiota, their roles in
the host system, their potential application, link to zoonotic diseases can be accessed. Web tools included in
this site offer versatility and quick access to basic bacterial information (morphological, taxonomy, genetic
sequences, and phenotypic and chemotaxonomic information). Data on microbiota will be obtained from
open-access journals and referenced by NCBI Pubmed, Sciencedirect, Research gate, Elsevier and Web of
Science. With Data Analytics features, BASILIO allows quick access to information on the relevance of
particular microbiota isolated and identified by various researchers worldwide.
